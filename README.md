# Jimdo 
[Jimdo](https://www.jimdo.com/) is a user-friendly website builder that allows anyone to create websites without coding. It offers customizable templates, drag-and-drop design, and tools for e-commerce and SEO. Ideal for small businesses and individuals, Jimdo simplifies creating a professional online presence. 
Using Jimdo can save a lot of time compared to building a website from scratch. 

### Choose "Creator" plan ☝️

However, there are some limitations to editing. With the "Creator" plan, Jimdo allows users to modify the Head HTML. 
In HTML, when you use the script tag, it allows you to write JavaScript code. I managed the code and created a translation function in the navbar.

I also added an Instagram icon, which Jimdo does not natively support. With some custom code, you can extend Jimdo’s functionality beyond its standard offerings, allowing you to implement features!
